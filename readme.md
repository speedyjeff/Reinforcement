The intention for this repo was a series of learnings of how to apply Q Learning/Neural networks, reinforcement learning, on practical problems.  The algorithm for [q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning) are straight forward to implement in 10's of lines of code.  The algorithm for [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_artificial_neural_networks) are more complicated and to fully understand the underlying math you need a basis in calculus.

Problems like Tic-Tac-Toe are interesting to implement as it only has 3K unique boards with 10K unique actions across these boards.  The domain can fit within a releatively small amount of memory.
